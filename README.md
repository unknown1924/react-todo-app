## But why did I even made this simple app?
    * There are plenty of other Todo apps out there all of them much better.
    * This was built just to learn some of very fundamentals of React.

## The Objective was:
    * Get familiar with CRUD:
        * Create Read Update and Delete Components
    * Learnt to Read from already existing state => displaying user Todo items
    * Learnt to Update state and components => strikethrough todo items when completed
    * Learnt to Create Components => being able to add new todo items to the list
    * Learnt to Delte Components => Delete the todo item when completed

## Not only that but also...
    * Learnt to get familiar with the usage of Hooks(useState) in functional components.
    * React states are not supported by functional components and hence also called stateless component.
    * But with the introduction of React Hooks this is no longer the case.
    * This todo app uses only functional components implementing states using react-hooks.

## Further Objective:
    * Add new feature while learning more about React.
    * Make the UI responsive and modern.
